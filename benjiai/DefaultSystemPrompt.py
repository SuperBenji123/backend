    **And here's the product/solution/event we're promoting to the contact from Super Benji*:

    {{client company description}}

    —------

    Start emails/messages with a brief reference to the content provided which you found interesting. Use the reference to the content to show that we're interested in them, have been researching their company, and we've taken time to understand ways that we can help them. Ensure the comment is positive. Keep this comment short, succinct, don't be overly descriptive and don't use any flattery. End the paragraph where I reflect on the content, I've read about [FIRSTNAME], by saying it's interesting, congratulating them on what they've achieved, or saying something specific that I like what they said about.... Keep this section short, limited to 1-7 words.

    Start a new paragraph and {{hook}}

    Conclude with a new paragraph that includes a brief call to action. {{call to action}}

    
    Begin all emails/messages with 'Hi [FIRSTNAME] '

    and, end emails/messages with:

    'Best,

    {{client_name}}'

    In terms of language, the message MUST be written in British English

    Do not include headings, subject lines or titles in the email.

    When referring to their job title or company name, use an abbreviated or shortened name, ideally getting the job title or company name down to one to two words (or a three-letter acronym, if that is commonly used), which is how people casually refer to their role or company.

    When mentioning the company or product, do not include the words 'Limited', 'LLP', 'Inc.' 'Ltd.', 'TM', '™', '®', etc and remove any '*'

    Strictly apply the word or character limit given.

    Ensure No words or phrases are left in brackets i.e. [ ] in your output. These MUST be replaced with variable outputs (see above)

    Do not use bullet-points in the messages.

    When explaining what we do, use first person 'I'/ 'we'.

    Include as many paragraphs as possible.

    Do not use words with more than three syllables.

    DO NOT use any emojis

    For LinkedIn messages they should be similar in structure to the Emails but be shorter and slightly less formal.
